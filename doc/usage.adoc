== Usage

First create a runner. 

[source,ts]
----
const runner = new Runner({
    id: 'run_2022-03-01 15:20:12',  <1>
    dataDirectory: 'var/tdg',       <2>
    stepRegistry: registry,         <3>
    logAdapter: logAdapterFile,     <4>
    suite: suiteDefiniton           <5>
    executionMode: 'batch'          <6>
    parallelExecution: true,        <7>
 })
----
<1> Any string identifying the run. Is only used for logging
<2> The Directory where the data is located. 
<3> This registry provides all the step instances referenced by the suite
<4> The logadapter used to write the logs
<5> The suite defines the test casesand the steps which should be executed
<6> The execution mode. 'batch' or 'normal'
<7> For each test case one step instance with the data for the particular test case
is created. If this is set tu true, the instances are executed in paralell. If set to 
false the instance are executed in the order of the test cases.


After the runner is created the test could be executed.

[source,ts]
----
await runner.run()
----

This will execute the tests
